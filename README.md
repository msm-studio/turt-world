# Turt World

A whimsical, friendly platformer game where you choose from 4 adorable characters and navigate through themed levels. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Rapier2D physics, and Supabase.

## Features

- **4 Unique Characters** with distinct physics properties:
  - Turtle: Slower but heavier (less air control)
  - Pig: Balanced physics with faster acceleration
  - Lemur: Lightweight, extra air control, higher jumps
  - Axolotl: Slowest movement but can float slightly longer in air

- **Themed Levels**: Desert, Jungle, Arctic, and Urban landscapes
- **Real Physics**: Powered by Rapier2D for smooth, responsive gameplay
- **Leaderboard System**: Submit scores and compete with others
- **Beautiful UI**: Warm, whimsical art style with smooth animations

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React + TypeScript
- **Physics Engine**: Rapier2D
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works great)
- A GitHub account
- A Vercel account (optional, for deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turt-world.git
cd turt-world
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to SQL Editor and run the schema from `db/schema.sql`
   - This will create the tables and insert default characters and the first level

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.local` and update with your Supabase credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move left/right
- **Space** or **W/Up Arrow**: Jump (hold for higher jump)

## How to Add New Characters

1. Open your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Insert a new character:

```sql
INSERT INTO characters (name, speed, jump_force, mass, air_control, float_time, description) VALUES
  ('NewCharacter', 3.5, 13.5, 1.8, 0.4, 0, 'Your character description');
```

3. Update the character colors and emojis in `components/game/CharacterSelect.tsx`:

```typescript
const characterColors: Record<string, string> = {
  // ... existing characters
  NewCharacter: 'bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700',
};

const characterEmojis: Record<string, string> = {
  // ... existing characters
  NewCharacter: '🦔',
};
```

4. The character will automatically appear in the character selection screen!

## How to Design New Levels

Levels are stored as JSON in the Supabase `levels` table. Here's how to add one:

1. Open your Supabase SQL Editor
2. Insert a new level:

```sql
INSERT INTO levels (name, theme, order_index, unlocked_by_default, layout) VALUES
  ('Your Level Name', 'Jungle', 2, FALSE, '{
    "background": {
      "color": "#228B22",
      "layers": [
        {"type": "sky", "color": "#87CEEB"},
        {"type": "trees", "color": "#006400", "parallax": 0.3}
      ]
    },
    "platforms": [
      {"x": 50, "y": 550, "width": 200, "height": 20, "type": "ground"},
      {"x": 300, "y": 450, "width": 150, "height": 20, "type": "wood"}
    ],
    "hazards": [
      {"x": 450, "y": 580, "width": 40, "height": 60, "type": "spike"}
    ],
    "start": {"x": 100, "y": 450},
    "goal": {"x": 1150, "y": 350, "width": 60, "height": 80}
  }');
```

### Level Layout Format

- **platforms**: Array of platform objects with position, size, and type
- **hazards**: Array of hazard objects (touching these kills the player)
- **start**: Player spawn position
- **goal**: Level completion trigger area
- **background**: Colors and parallax layers for visual depth

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repo to Vercel at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Add your environment variables in Vercel's dashboard
4. Deploy!

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your game.
